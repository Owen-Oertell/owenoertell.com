Hello! My name is Owen Oertell and I am a rising senior at Chamblee Charter High School in Atlanta, GA!

I am interested in quantiative finance, CS, and Machine learning.

I plan on writing primarily about cool CS and ML topics as well as college admissions if I feel particularly opinionated.

My main values are having a strong moral compass and ever-growing curiosity.

I mainly program in C, C++, and Python but have good knowlege of web frameworks as well as backend and database languages.

My current main projects are:
* YStem and Chess &mdash; Found [here](https://ystemandchess.com).
* Work on Copy Number Variation at Tech &mdash; and hopefully being able to fufill my dream of getting published!
* Co-Founder of [PrepByAI](https://prepbyai.com), which is a test prep organization hoping to help kids prepare for the ACT using machine learning.

Past Things I have created (still trying to remember):
* MasterPass &mdash; A password managment program written in C# with SHA-256 bit encryption.
