*Note: This post is still under construction. These are not my final thoughts.*

Let me share a common experience among researchers: you receive a review noting some weaknesses, address them in your rebuttal, and then face the dreaded words: *I will keep my score.* After reviewing for ICLR 2025, and inspired by a recent post, I've come to realize that this response often means: "The work is good, but I don't find it *exciting*."

Before exploring what makes research exciting, I should clarify: my goal isn't simply to boost my reviewer scores or publish more papers in top conferences—it's to pursue what I consider truly *exciting* research. This isn't to suggest my current work lacks excitement. On the contrary, I believe it's quite engaging. However, there's always room for improvement, and I expect the challenge of conducting exciting research will only intensify during my PhD.

I think that there are four key points for when it comes to creating exciting research — **simplicity, impact, novelty,** and **clear communication**. These aren’t hard and fast rules: recent large language model development have had developments where scaling laws have been the driving factors, but I think overall following these properties leads to exciting research.

While I believe that these are the four elements which make up exciting research, it’s not clear how to achieve this. And that makes sense, this type of research is challenging. Yet I believe the most groundbreaking work stems from *goal-driven research*. This approach is guided by a specific vision, a worldview, and a conviction that certain lines of inquiry will lead there. The researchers I admire most (including my undergraduate advisors) have a clear purpose in mind, which I believe is crucial for producing good, exciting research. While it’s common in talks for speakers to weave a narrative through their papers, I suspect this often happens in retrospect. By establishing this direction before beginning research, we can chart a clearer course and ultimately produce stronger work. There are a few steps in goal driven research, but I will briefly talk about the first one in this post: finding a goal.

## Finding a goal

The first step in goal driven research is, well, finding a goal. Goals can take many forms, and often great researchers *do* talk about them in their talks. Whether that goal is to find [super human intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkpJMNjvgXw&list=PLEA9Mnr-L18lI_I-EkyAc1-gXgBj52oV5&index=5) or [optimizing generative models for drug discovery](https://www.masatoshiuehara.com), finding this guiding light is the key to start doing exciting research. Although I am yet to find a goal, I think finding a goal consists of an [explore-then-commit](http://chihaozhang.com/teaching/AA2022/notes/lec5.pdf) strategy. That is, first spend some amount of time exploring your options, surveying the landscape of problems and worldviews, and then finally commit: find a worldview that suits you and spend time trying to prove it right. It’s very possible that this worldview isn’t right or that the task is misspecified, so “commit” here has a lot flexibility. So much so that you may even change your worldview. But hopefully one has explored enough such that these changes are minimal throughout time.

Good goals must be specific enough such that you can have some definite time when it’s accomplished but hard enough such that it would take a long time to complete. And finally, just as an entrepreneur must make sure that their product has a need, you must make sure your goal has will be impactful.

I am still in the explore phase of this strategy — so I’m not sure how much I can comment on the quality of goals or even how to choose one, since I haven’t even done that myself. So I will wait and maybe revisit this in a few years.

## No panacea

Unfortunately, there isn’t a panacea in order to truly do good research, but I think through practice and (hopefully) somewhat following a goal driven research approach, my research will be all the more *exciting*. I look forward to doing a PhD and hope that through this blog I will also be able to document my quest to do exciting research.
